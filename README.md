# GigaMath

The main idea of Gigamath is that it will be a library of different functions along with a main application which will be able to take in any equation and output the steps to solving it along with an explanation.

Functions will be written primarily in Python, however, I plan on rewriting them all in other languages as well, specifically Java, JS, C, C++, Swift and anything else I come up with

This is just a fun side project so any development may be sparse
